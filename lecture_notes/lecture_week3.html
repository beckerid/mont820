<h2>Mean</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Definition</strong>: The mean is the average of a data set, representing the central value of a discrete set of numbers.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Sensitivity</strong>: The mean is sensitive to outliers, as extreme values can significantly affect the average.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Calculation</strong>: The mean is calculated as the sum of all the values in the dataset divided by the number of values in the dataset. <span class="math display">\[\text{Mean} = \frac{\rm{Sum\ of\ Values\ in\ Sample}}{\rm{Number\ of\ Observations}} = \frac{x_1+x_2\dots+x_N}{N}= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N{x_n}\]</span></li>

<li class="fragment"><p>The formula for the median in an ordered dataset is:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Standard Deviation</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><p><strong>Definition</strong>: The standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data values. It indicates how much individual data points deviate from the mean (average) value of the dataset.</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p><strong>Indication</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">A low standard deviation means that most of the data points are very close to the mean</li>

<h2>Standard Deviation (cont.)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Calculation</strong>:
<ul>
<li class="fragment">The standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the average of the squared deviations of each value from the mean.</li>

<h2>T-Distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>
<li class="fragment">The t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution but has thicker tails.</li>
<li class="fragment">This means that it is more prone to producing values that fall far from its mean.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Use</strong>: It is particularly useful when dealing with small sample sizes or when the population variance is unknown.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="t-distribution-vs.-normal-distribution" class="slide level2">
<h2>T-Distribution vs.&nbsp;Normal Distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><p><strong>Thicker Tails</strong>: This leads to more extreme values compared to the normal distribution, making the t-distribution more suitable for small samples.</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p><strong>Degrees of Freedom</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">The shape of the t-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom.</li>
<li class="fragment">With more degrees of freedom, the t-distribution looks more like the normal distribution.</li>
</ul></li>

<h1>Hypothesis Testing Overview</h1>

</section>
<section id="hypothesis-testing-an-introduction" class="slide level2">
<h2>Hypothesis Testing: An Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Hypothesis testing is a statistical process used to draw conclusions about a population, based on sample data.</li>
<li class="fragment">Hypothesis testing compares the likelihood of validity of two mutually exclusive statements</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="null-hypothesis" class="slide level2">
<h2>Null Hypothesis</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Null Hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>):</strong> The Null Hypothesis is a statement of no effect, no difference, or no change, and is assumed true until evidence indicates otherwise.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">It serves as the default or baseline assumption in hypothesis testing and is formulated to be easily tested by statistical methods.</li>
<li class="fragment">For example, if we are testing a new drug, the Null Hypothesis might state that the drug has no effect on patients compared to a placebo.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="alternative-hypothesis" class="slide level2">
<h2>Alternative Hypothesis</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>):</strong> The Alternative Hypothesis proposes an effect, difference, or change and is considered only when there is sufficient evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">It is the statement that the researcher aims to support with evidence.</li>
<li class="fragment">Continuing the drug example, the Alternative Hypothesis might claim that the drug has a significant effect on patients compared to a placebo.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-process-of-hypothesis-testing" class="slide level2">
<h2>The Process of Hypothesis Testing:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li class="fragment"><strong>Formulate an Initial Assumption:</strong> Establish the Null Hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) as the default position.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gather sample data that will serve as evidence in the testing process.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Evidence Analysis:</strong> Analyze the collected data to either support or refute the Null Hypothesis.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Based on the evidence, decide whether to reject (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) in favor of (<span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>) or not.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="understanding-the-outcome" class="slide level2">
<h2>Understanding the Outcome:</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><p>The outcomes of hypothesis testing can be categorized into four possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>True Positive:</strong> The scenario where (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) is true and is rightly not rejected.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>True Negative:</strong> The case where (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) is false, (<span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>) is true, and (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) is correctly rejected.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>False Positive (Type I Error):</strong> Occurs when (<span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>) is incorrectly accepted despite (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) being true.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>False Negative (Type II Error):</strong> Happens when (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) is wrongly rejected despite (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) being true.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="illustrative-examples-of-errors-in-a-drug-trial-context" class="slide level2">
<h2>Illustrative Examples of Errors in a Drug Trial Context:</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Type I Error:</strong> Consider a drug trial where the Null Hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) is that the new drug has no effect on patients compared to a placebo.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">A Type I Error would occur if the trial results incorrectly suggest that the drug is effective, leading to the wrongful rejection of (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>).</li>
<li class="fragment">This is akin to approving a drug that is actually no better than a placebo, potentially causing unnecessary exposure to side effects without any health benefits.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="illustrative-examples-of-errors-in-a-drug-trial-context-cont" class="slide level2">
<h2>Illustrative Examples of Errors in a Drug Trial Context (cont):</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Type II Error:</strong> In the same drug trial
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Type II Error would happen if the results fail to show the drug’s effectiveness, even when it truly is beneficial, leading to the wrongfully failing to reject (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>).</li>
<li class="fragment">This scenario is similar to overlooking a potentially life-saving medication due to insufficient evidence of its efficacy, denying patients a beneficial treatment.</li>
